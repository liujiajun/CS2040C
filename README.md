Module: CS2040C Data Structures and Algorithms AY18/19
================
PS0: 10/10 problems solved. Check the [problem staments](https://nus.kattis.com/sessions/ex9sme )

PS1: 3/3 problems solved. Check the [problem statements](https://nus.kattis.com/sessions/tm8b74)

PS2: 3/3 solved. The ferry problem is a bit tedious. A tricky case to consider: when the ferry carries some cars to the right, it will stay there until the next car comes to the left bank. (P.S. test case 2 probably consists of a considerate amount of cars since it took 0.2s for the program to execute.)
